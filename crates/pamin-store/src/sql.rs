//! Every such column carries a CHECK constraint naming the same set of labels,
//! so the SQL and the Rust have to agree. Writing the two directions by hand
//! per enum is how they stop agreeing: a variant gets added, one of the two
//! matches gets updated, and the mismatch surfaces as a value that reads back
//! as something else. Here one list generates both directions, and a test
//! holds the SQL to the same list.
