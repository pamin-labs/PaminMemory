//! Turning text in any language into indexable tokens.
//!
//! The retrieval engine's own tokenizers cover UAX#29 word breaking, Chinese
//! through a dictionary, and character n-grams. That leaves Japanese, Korean,
//! Thai, Khmer, Lao, and Burmese with only n-grams, which index but match
//! across word boundaries and lose precision.
//!
//! Segmenting here closes that gap without adding a second search engine. ICU4X
//! applies UAX#29 to most languages, dictionaries to Chinese and Japanese, and
//! an LSTM model to Thai, Khmer, Lao, and Burmese, and it is pure Rust, so no
//! C++ toolchain comes with it.
//!
//! Only the index input is rewritten. Evidence is stored verbatim in
//! PostgreSQL, and nothing here touches it: a segmented string is a projection
//! that can be thrown away and rebuilt.
