//! Local embeddings.
//!
//! Inference runs on this machine through ONNX Runtime. The default install
//! needs no API key and makes no network call at query time, which is what
//! keeps memory free to use and keeps evidence off third-party infrastructure.
//!
//! Two different operations are easy to conflate here. Quantizing model weights
//! buys a large CPU speedup for well under a percent of quality; storing output
//! vectors as int8 costs one and a half to three and a half percent and needs a
//! calibration set. The first is worth taking and the second is not,
//! particularly since the default reranker has no cross-encoder to recover the
//! loss.
//!
//! Neither is in force today. Stored vectors are float32 and will stay that
//! way. Weight quantization is unavailable rather than declined: the model
//! registry publishes quantized variants for several families but none for
//! multilingual E5, so both default profiles run full-precision weights.
