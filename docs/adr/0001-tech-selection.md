## Context

PaminMemory stores durable evidence, keeps a versioned ledger of how facts change, and retrieves context through several independent channels fused into one explainable result. Before writing code we had to settle the language, the authoritative store, the retrieval engine, how any human language gets tokenized, and how embeddings are produced.

Three criteria decided every question: **fast, cheap, accurate**. A decision that appears to improve all three without a cost has not been examined closely enough, so each choice below states which criterion pays.

One rule ran through all of it:

> **Delete components that overlap. Keep components that complement.**

## Decision

| Layer | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Language | Rust `1.98.1`, 2024 edition |
| Async runtime | Tokio |
| Database driver | `tokio-postgres` |
| Migrations | `refinery` |
| Authoritative store | PostgreSQL, bundled via `postgresql_embedded` |
| Retrieval engine | `zvec` (in-process, BM25 full-text and dense vectors) |
| Segmentation | `icu_segmenter` (ICU4X) |
| Language detection | `whatlang` |
| Embeddings | `fastembed` over ONNX Runtime, `multilingual-e5-base` by default |
| CLI | `clap` |

Nothing is hand-written where a mature crate already covers it. Migrations use `refinery` rather than a hand-rolled runner, and the same rule applies to argument parsing, configuration, and logging.

## Rationale

### Language: Rust

Three languages were considered seriously. C# was ruled out first: `zvec` publishes no C# SDK, and Lucene.NET is still at `4.8.0-beta` with its stable release stuck on Lucene 3.0.3, so both the retrieval engine and any local full-text fallback would have to be built.

Go became viable once `tantivy` left the design, because `zvec` publishes an official Go SDK. Rust still wins on three points:

- **Segmentation.** ICU4X is a pure Rust crate. Go has no equivalent and would need CGO into `icu4c`. Since segmentation is where multilingual accuracy comes from, this is not a peripheral dependency.
- **Embeddings.** `ort` is an ordinary crate. Go needs CGO, which costs easy cross-compilation and static linking, or `purego`, which its own documentation labels beta and which loads symbols at runtime, so the binary stops being self-contained.
- **Modelling.** An immutable version ledger, a `why[]` trace, and filter decisions are sum types with exhaustive matching. Go has no sum types, and this is the part of the codebase that carries the product's differentiator.

Rust's real costs are a cold build that compiles the whole dependency tree and a `target/` directory measured in gigabytes. Both are addressed by keeping the dependency tree deliberately thin, by splitting the workspace so the heavy crate rebuilds rarely, and by the budget gates described below — not by pretending they do not exist.

Speed did not decide this. The workload is I/O against PostgreSQL, index queries inside native code, and ONNX inference in C++; the host language is a small share of total latency. Distribution size did not decide it either: the bundled PostgreSQL, the ONNX Runtime, and the embedding model together dwarf the binary.

### Authoritative store: PostgreSQL

The authority layer is OLTP-shaped throughout: a `SKIP LOCKED` outbox, a write-contention protocol that claims topic locks in sorted order inside a transaction, a partial index that resolves the current topic state, foreign keys with cross-entity transactions, and point lookups by `(topic_id, version)`.

Columnar engines were considered and rejected for this layer. Apache DataFusion is a query engine and provides no storage authority; Lance and Parquet are columnar formats, and while Lance offers MVCC and an append-only transaction log, columnar systems write large immutable blocks, so a single-row update often rewrites a block. They would replace nothing — vectors still need `zvec`, transactions still need something else — while adding a very large dependency tree. Cost falls on **cheap** and **accurate**, both against.

PostgreSQL is also the shortest path to a distributed future rather than an obstacle to it, because the ecosystem of PostgreSQL-compatible distributed engines is the largest of any database. Four rules keep that path open from the first migration:

1. Every table carries `project_id` and is designed for sharding on it.
2. Only the portable SQL subset is used: `SKIP LOCKED`, `SELECT FOR UPDATE`, partial indexes, foreign keys, CTEs. A test rejects the rest.
3. No `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, no advisory locks, no PostgreSQL-only extensions.
4. UUID primary keys, never `SERIAL`.

Doing this now costs nothing. Doing it after a cloud tier exists is a migration.

PostgreSQL is bundled rather than brought by the user. `pamin init` provisions and hosts a local instance through `postgresql_embedded`, so there is no Docker and no configuration. This changes only the distribution mechanism; PostgreSQL remains the sole authority.

### Retrieval engine: one engine, `zvec`

`zvec` runs in-process and covers both channels we need from an index: BM25 full-text search and dense vectors, with write-ahead logging, per-field tokenizers, and index types that scale from memory to disk.

`tantivy` was evaluated for the lexical channel and rejected. It is a second BM25 inverted index next to the one `zvec` already provides — the overlap half of the rule. Choosing it would have meant a second index directory, a second rebuild path, and real compile cost for capability already present.

`zvec` is pre-1.0 and has made breaking changes between minor versions. Two mitigations make that acceptable, and both are executable rather than declared:

- It appears only in `pamin-index`, behind the `Projection` trait; `zvec` types must not reach `pamin-core`. Both halves are checked rather than reviewed: the trait is what `pamin-engine` holds, and `ci/budget.py` fails the build if the engine becomes reachable from a crate outside `pamin-index`, `pamin-engine`, and `pamin-cli`.
- The index is fully rebuildable from PostgreSQL, and `pamin reindex` is delivered and tested alongside it. A breaking upgrade is therefore a reindex, not a migration.

LanceDB and Qdrant Edge were also evaluated. LanceDB has the broadest tokenizer coverage available, but its Rust crate is pre-1.0 and pulls roughly sixty direct dependencies including Arrow and DataFusion, which is exactly the build cost this project is trying to avoid. Qdrant Edge runs in-process with on-device BM25, but its API is documented as beta.

### Fusion stays in our layer

`zvec` offers client-side hybrid search and reranking helpers. **We do not use them.**

The graph channel lives in PostgreSQL, where `zvec` cannot see it. Letting the engine pre-fuse the lexical and vector lists would produce an already-fused list that then has to be fused again with the graph list, double-weighting its members and destroying the contract that every result reports its rank in every channel it appeared in.

Recall engines return per-channel ranked lists. Reciprocal rank fusion at `k = 60` runs in our layer, followed by post-fusion modifiers. This is a correctness requirement, not a preference.

### Three recall channels, not seven

An earlier channel list had seven entries. Four were redundant, and two of those double-counted against modifiers the same design already applied after fusion:

- **Temporal** and **pinned/important** were already post-fusion modifiers. Running them as channels as well counted the same signal twice. "Facts valid at time T" is a filter over other channels, not an independent recall source.
- **Curated notes** and **page nodes** already enter the projection index. A separate channel queries the same data twice and splits one population into several, which dilutes results and forces the redundancy penalty to reason across populations.

What remains:

```text
recall channels (3)   lexical, vector, graph
document types        topic_state / span / page_node / note   (a filter)
post-fusion modifiers recency, version currentness, importance and worth,
                      source quality, stale/superseded penalty, redundancy penalty
agentic primitives    grep, read by id, navigate, typed query
```

All three criteria improve: four fewer query groups per search, four fewer channels of code and index, and no double-weighted recency or importance.

### Segmentation: ICU4X in the application layer

Users write in any language in the world. `zvec` ships `standard` (UAX#29), `jieba`, `ngram`, ASCII folding, and a Snowball stemmer, which documents no handling for Japanese, Korean, Thai, Khmer, Lao, or Burmese. Those six fall back to `ngram`, which indexes them but matches across word boundaries and loses precision.

The fix is a segmenter, not a second search engine:

```text
source text (any language, stored verbatim)
  -> icu_segmenter        UAX#29 for most languages
                          dictionary for Chinese and Japanese
                          LSTM for Thai, Khmer, Lao, Burmese
  -> space-joined tokens  index input only; evidence is never rewritten
  -> zvec standard tokenizer -> BM25
queries pass through the same pipeline
```

This is the complement half of the rule: ICU4X segments, `zvec` retrieves, and neither does the other's job. It is pure Rust, so it adds no C++ build step, and it leaves the evidence layer untouched.

A second full-text field indexes the raw text with the `ngram` tokenizer, covering substrings that segmentation destroys: file paths, error codes, function names, configuration keys, and partial identifiers. Both fields are native `zvec` per-field configuration. The cost is roughly double the lexical index, paid by **cheap**, and whether it is worth paying is a question for the evaluation harness.

### Embeddings: profiles, and two different meanings of INT8

"INT8" names two operations whose costs differ by an order of magnitude, and conflating them is easy:

| | What it is | Measured cost | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Model weight INT8 | ONNX weights quantized for CPU inference | 2.7–3.4x faster, under 0.5% MTEB | **Unavailable** |
| Stored vector INT8 | Output embeddings stored as int8 rather than float32 | 1.5–3.5% loss, plus a calibration dataset | **Off, permanently** |

Weight quantization is a trade worth taking and we do not get to take it. The model registry we load from publishes quantized variants for several embedding families, but none for multilingual E5, so both default profiles run full-precision weights. An earlier draft of this decision recorded it as on by default, which was never true of the shipped models.

Stored vectors are float32 and stay that way. This is a decision rather than a default awaiting evidence: a single workspace holds thousands to low millions of vectors, where float32 storage is inexpensive, so the compression buys little, while the deterministic reranker has no cross-encoder to recover the several percent of accuracy it costs. The variant that would be worth taking is float8, which reaches the same 4x compression under 0.3% loss, and `zvec` offers RaBitQ and PQ-INT8 rather than float8. If that changes, the decision is worth revisiting; memory pressure alone is not a reason to trade accuracy we cannot recover.

The embedding model is a profile, not a constant:

| Profile | Model | Dimensions | Position |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `speed` | `multilingual-e5-small` | 384 | Bulk ingestion, low-spec machines |
| `balanced` (default) | `multilingual-e5-base` | 768 | Default |
| `accuracy` | BGE-M3 | 1024 | Dense and sparse in one pass, longer context |

`multilingual-e5-base` is the default because 384 dimensions is generally considered sufficient only when paired with a cross-encoder reranker, and our default reranker is deterministic and has none. Defaulting to the smaller model would have paired the weaker model with the weaker reranker.

BGE-M3 is not the default: its main increment is a sparse arm that overlaps the two lexical channels we already have, and its cost per query is an order of magnitude higher. EmbeddingGemma scores well and supports Matryoshka truncation, but is governed by the Gemma Terms of Use, whose restrictions must be passed to downstream users; that is not an acceptable burden to attach to an open-source default. It remains available as an opt-in profile. The E5 family and BGE-M3 are Apache-2.0 or MIT.

Learned sparse retrieval such as SPLADE outperforms BM25 on most benchmarks but requires GPU inference, which is incompatible with a default install that needs no API key and no GPU. It stays a profile, not a default.

### Engineering budgets

Retrieval quality is governed by numeric gates. Engineering cost gets the same treatment, because otherwise it drifts silently — and an earlier iteration of this decision would have added compile cost for capability the project already had.

CI measures binary size, dependency count, cold build time, incremental check time, and `target/` size. The first two are gated. Build times are reported rather than gated: shared runners vary enough that a wall-clock gate would fail at random, and a flaky gate teaches people to ignore gates.

Exceeding a budget is a trade to record in the pull request, not drift to accept.

## Consequences

- A cold build compiles the whole dependency tree, and `target/` is large. The dependency tree is kept thin deliberately: no `sqlx`, whose compile-time macros are a well-known build cost, and no web or metrics stack until something calls it.
- `zvec` is pre-1.0, so a breaking upgrade will require a reindex. `pamin reindex` exists from the first release precisely so this stays routine.
- Building `zvec` downloads a prebuilt native library, and ONNX Runtime does the same. Neither compiles C++ locally, but both require network access at build time and a measure of supply-chain trust.
- Two full-text fields roughly double the lexical index. This is a measured trade, revisited when the evaluation harness exists.
- Fusion in our own layer means more code than calling an engine helper. That code is the explainability contract, so it is the product rather than overhead.
